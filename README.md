## DataScience-Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic and self learning purposes.

### 1 . DataScience with Python 
[Link to Code](https://github.com/lavanyat15/DataScience-Code/tree/main/(C2)DataScience%20with%20Python%20)

The task involves identifying which customer attributes relate significantly to customer default rates and to build a predictive model one can use to better classify potential customers as being ‘at-risk’. Used machine learning regression methods in Python for this task. 
The skills practiced in this course include:

* Preprocessing data (e.g., Feature selection, addressing missing data, cleaning data)
* Applying machine learning techniques to classification problems
* Using the Matplotlib Python 2D plotting library 
* Applying cross-validation methods
* Assessing the predictive performance of classifiers by examining key error metrics
* Using the Sci-Kit Learn machine learning library for Python
* Comparing and selecting different predictive models
* Applying predictive models to test sets

```
Tools: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
Models : SVR, RandomForest Regressor, Linear Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier

```

## 2 . Data Analytics: Predicting Customer Preferences in R 
[Link to Code](https://github.com/lavanyat15/DataScience-Code/tree/main/(C3)Predicting%20customer%20Pref%20in%20R)

There are 2 parts to this course 
1. Used machine learning methods to predict which brand of computer products customers prefer, based on customer demographics collected from a marketing survey 
 
2. Determine associations between products that will be used to drive sales-oriented initiatives such as recommender systems .

The skills practiced in this course represent current professional practice and include:

* Applying data mining in e-commerce (e.g. profitability prediction, customer segmentation, product selection strategy)
* Preprocessing data for data mining
* Using data mining tools and different classifiers (e.g., k-nearest neighbor, decision trees, support vector machines) to develop predictive models
* Applying machine learning techniques to classification and regression problems
* Optimizing classifiers by adjusting and testing hyperparameters
* Applying cross-validation methods
* Assessing the predictive performance of classifiers by examining key error metrics
* Comparing and selecting different predictive models
* Applying predictive models to test sets

```
Tools: R, R Studio, Caret, ggplot2, Arules, Arulesviz, Plotly
Models : GBM, Random Forest, C5.0, SVM, XGBoost
